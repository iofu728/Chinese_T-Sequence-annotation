\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce two deep-learning sequence annotation model. Both BiLstm + CRF and Bert-CRF well in this task. And Bert can get more semantic info on context.
The pad position also has some effect on this model.
I achieve a 97.60\% Recall score on CWS,  Macro-F1 is 97.78\% by using Bert CRF, And in NER,  I achieve a 93.32\% Recall score on NER,  Macro-F1 is 96,92\% by using Bert CRF.
Every score is better than the rank 1 in the competition.
